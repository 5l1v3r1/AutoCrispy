# Baisc How-to's

This will serve as a guide for common programs that support custom textures, and how to configure AutoCrispy to work with them.  **The information is not a definitive guide by any means, and neither presents the only or best way to accomplish these tasks!**

This is just how I've found to set these up, and it may be helpful to those who have never done somthing like this before.


  ## Dolphin
  
  Dolphin does support both Dumping and Loading custom textures, but does not seem to check for *changes* in the custom textures whilst running. There is a workaround with Hotkeys.
  
  **TL;DR** Enable Texture Dumping. Set a hotkey for "Toggle Custom Textures". Setup and run AutoCrispy and the Game. Toggle every so often to update your textures.

  ## PPSSPP
  
  PPSSPP is great. It supports Dumping *and* Hotloading textures. All you need is some INI tweaks and you're golden.
  
  **TL;DR** Turn on Dumping and Loading textures. Make an INI with the settings below. Setup and run AutoCrispy and the Game.
